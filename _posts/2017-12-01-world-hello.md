## compose(world, hello)

Hi! I’m Ryan and I’m a JavaScript developer. I do some freelance and open source, and I'm for hire. I’m also a great friend and live with two awesome (though a bit crazy) dogs.

I plan to write here mostly about frontend development. Probably something about philosophy, my life and other things if it’s interesting for you. Feel free to drop me a line [by email](mailto:stegmannrd@gmail.com) or [by phone](tel:19519922715).
